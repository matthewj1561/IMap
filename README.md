# Overview

# IMap
A simple android app made using the google maps API.

To learn the basics of android app development, I choose to create an app that allowed users to place comments only at their current location, and then allow them to make a comment the corresponded with their surroundings. 

When a user opens the app, they are greated with a world map. After pressing the location button at the top right-hand corner of the screen, they can then place a comment at their current location.

In the future, multiple users will be able to use the app and view other's comments when they are in the near vincinity of said comment.

# Future Work

* Include circles around markers. Users will only be able to view comments if they are within the circle.
* Upload comments and markers to cloud database. Populate app with saved comments.
* Allow for multiple users to operate the app and see each other's comments.
